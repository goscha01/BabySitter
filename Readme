**Baby Sitter Test Project**
1. The project was written with a goal of accomplish a test assigment for Pillar using Test Driving Development.
2. The Git repository for the project is here https://github.com/goscha01/BabySitter.
3. This is my first Test Driven Development project, so the project logic has been developed during writing test cases.
